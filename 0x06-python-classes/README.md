# Python-Classes and Objects.

OOP is a totally new concept for all of you (especially those who think they know about it :)). It’s VERY important that you read at least all the material that is listed bellow (and skip what we recommend you to skip, you will see them later in the curriculum).

As usual, make sure you type (never copy and paste), test, understand all examples shown in the following links (including those in the video), test again etc. The biggest and most important takeaway of this project is: experiment by yourself OOP, play with it!

## Read:

*Object Oriented Programming (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” excluded. You do NOT have to learn about class attributes, classmethod and staticmethod yet)(https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/i49z6HxrBGRNnixo7ZWbEQ)

#Tasks:

Task One: Write and empty class 'square' that defines a square. You are not allowed to import any modules.
